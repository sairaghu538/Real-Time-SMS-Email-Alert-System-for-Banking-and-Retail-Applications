# Real-Time-SMS-Email-Alert-System-for-Banking-and-Retail-Applications

Step 1: Set Up AWS Account and SNS Service
Log into AWS Console: Once signed in, search for Amazon SNS in the AWS Console and navigate to the SNS Dashboard.
Create SNS Topic:
Click on Create topic.
Select the Standard type for the topic.
Name the topic (e.g., notifications-topic).
Optionally, set a Display name for SMS.
Click Create topic.

Step 2: Set Up IAM Roles and Permissions for Lambda
Create IAM Role for Lambda:
Go to the IAM Dashboard and click Roles.
Create a new role with the following policies: AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole, AmazonSNSFullAccess.
Attach the role to your Lambda functions to enable them to interact with SNS and other AWS services.

Step 3: Create Lambda Functions for Notifications

Lambda functions will handle sending notifications when certain events (like account creation or transactions) occur.
Create Lambda for Account Creation (Email/SMS):
Go to AWS Lambda and create a function named account-creation-notification.
Select the IAM Role you created earlier.
Write the following code to send an email and SMS when a new account is created (applicable to both banking and retail):

1. Create Lambda for Transaction/Order Alerts:
Create another Lambda function named transaction-alert-notification.
This function will notify users when a transaction (banking) or order (retail) is processed.

2. Create Lambda for Balance/Inventory Update Alerts:
Create a Lambda named balance-update-alert for banking applications to notify users about balance changes, or for retail to notify about inventory levels.

3. Create Lambda for Security Alerts:
Create a Lambda function security-alert-notification to send security-related notifications, such as failed login attempts or password reset requests.

4.Create Lambda for Promotions/Discounts (Retail):
Create a Lambda named promotions-notification for sending promotional messages (e.g., discounts, offers).

Step 5: Set Up CloudWatch for Monitoring and Alerts

1. Monitor Lambda Executions: Set up CloudWatch Logs to track Lambda executions and catch errors.

2. Create CloudWatch Alarms: Set alarms to notify you in case of errors or failures in your Lambda functions.

Step 6: Testing and Validation

1. Test Lambda Functions: Manually trigger the Lambda functions with sample data to check if SMS and email notifications are being sent correctly.

2. Check CloudWatch Logs: Review logs for any issues or errors during execution.

3. Verify Subscriptions: Ensure that the users are receiving notifications via SMS and email.

Step 7: Deploy and Integrate with Your Application
1. Integrate with Web App: Once the notifications are working, integrate them into your live banking or retail application by triggering Lambda functions when certain events occur (e.g., account creation, transactions, orders).

2. Deploy Lambda Functions: Use AWS CodePipeline or manual deployment to push your Lambda functions to production.
